# js-goodies
Pure Javascript goodies without using any libraries.

### Why did I create this?
Since I started working with different javascript frameworks I became more reliant on them and less on javascript to the extent that during a hackathon I realised "Oh Sh*t I don't know how to do an asyncronus http request in javascript" and I had to download JQuery *embarrassing moments*.

This repo will contain all the "tough" tricks that most people don't realise cane be done in javascript.

## Prerequisites
First run `npm install lite-server -g` to install lite-server and use it
